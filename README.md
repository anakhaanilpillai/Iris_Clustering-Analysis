# Iris Clustering Analysis

## Objective
This project explores the clustering techniques applied to the Iris dataset. It includes the use of KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to identify clusters in the data based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Algorithms Used
1. **KMeans Clustering**: This algorithm divides the data into clusters based on centroids.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree-like structure to represent nested clusters.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook file to see the analysis.

## Usage
Run the `Iris_Clustering_Analysis.ipynb` to load the Iris dataset, preprocess it, and apply the clustering algorithms.
